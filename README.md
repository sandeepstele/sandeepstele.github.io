# Sandeep S Portfolio

This repository hosts the source for **Sandeep S**'s personal website. It is a static site built for GitHub Pages using Jekyll layouts and includes pages for projects, publications, courses and more.

## Structure

- `index.html` – landing page with hero and about sections.
- `projects.html` – curated list of featured work.
- `about.html`, `awards.html`, `courses.html`, etc. – additional sections of the site.
- `assets/` and `css/` – shared images, PDF files and stylesheets.

## Local development

The site can be built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

```bash
# Install Jekyll first if it isn't available
jekyll serve
```

This starts a local server at <http://localhost:4000> with live reloading.
